# Jarvis – Python Voice Assistant

A modular Python-based voice assistant created by **Sumit Kumar Hota**, originally built as a CBSE 12th-grade final project and continuously improved through college. Jarvis handles real-time speech recognition, user authentication, media playback, weather/news scraping, system control, and dynamic voice interactions — all using customizable `.txt` configuration files.

## 🛠️ How to Use

### ✅ Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

Make sure Python is installed. Then:

1. Open the folder that contains this project (where `requirements.txt` is located).
2. Click the folder's address bar and type `cmd`, then press **Enter** to open Command Prompt.
3. Now run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

📌 This installs all necessary modules — like `speechrecognition`, `pyttsx3`, `resemblyzer`, etc.

💡 If `pip` isn’t recognized, try:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ✅ Step 2: Set Up Configuration Files

Inside the `config/` folder:

- `custom_commands.txt` – define your custom voice commands and responses
- `song_dir.txt`, `video_dir.txt` – add full directory paths to your local media folders
- `state.txt`, `city.txt` – for news and weather scraping
- `birthday.txt` – your birthdate in `DD-MM` format

Also:
- Add your voice profiles in `voice_profiles/` using the recorder script `user voice input.py`.

### ✅ Step 3: Run Jarvis

Launch Jarvis with:
```bash
python main.py
```

Say **"Jarvis"** to activate and give commands like:  
🕒 *"What time is it?"*  
🎶 *"Play Faded"*  
🌤️ *"What’s the weather?"*  
📺 *"Play video XYZ"*  
📚 *"Search dogs on Wikipedia"*
